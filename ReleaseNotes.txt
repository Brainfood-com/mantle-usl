Release 1.0.0 - 24 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Mantle Universal Service Library 1.0.0 is the first release as a component
repository separate from the other components in Mantle Business Artifacts.

This release is based on Moqui Framework 1.6.1 and mantle-udm 1.0.0.

The initial code is from Mantle 1.2.0 and has only minor changes but has
updates for the new Moqui Framework component management features and use
of Bintray JCenter for jar files instead of local ones (used in automated
tests).
